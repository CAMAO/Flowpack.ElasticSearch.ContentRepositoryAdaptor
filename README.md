# TYPO3 Neos ElasticSearch Adapter

This project connects the TYPO3 Content Repository (TYPO3CR) to ElasticSearch; enabling two
main functionalities:

* Full-Text Indexing of Pages and other Documents (of course including the full content)
* finding Nodes in TypoScript / Eel by arbitrary queries

TODO Sebastian: this needs improved documentation!

If you need this package, ping Sebastian Kurfuerst or Karsten Dambekalns and bug them to update documentation :-)
